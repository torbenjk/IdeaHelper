        <h2>IdeaHelper</h2>
        <p>IdeaHelper is a tool, that helps you brainstorm ideas. It works like this: </p>
        <h3>1. Describe your challenge</h3>
        <p>First you describe your challenge or problem as specifically as possible:</p>
        <p>If you are writing a book, and gets stuck on the plot, it might be "How can the villain get rid of the murder weapon?". If you are arranging a birthday party for your kid, it could be "What fun game can I do with 10 kids in the living room?". If you are inventing a board game it might be "How can I avoid the players getting bored while waiting for their turn?". </p>
        <p>Do not be too abstract or vague: "What should I write a book about?" is not specific enough.</p>
        <h3>2. Create ideas from image or word prompts</h3>
        <p>Then you are prompted several times with different words and images, and asked to think about how these helps you come up with solutions to your challenge. Type in any ideas that you come up with, no matter how silly or impractical they might be.</p>
        <p>For example, your challenge might be "How can the villain get rid of the murder weapon?" and the prompt might be a photo of camels riding through a dessert. The camel makes you think of animals - maybe an animal eats the murder weapon. You write "An animal eats it". This makes you think of having a dog in the plot. 
            Maybe the victim is a dog-owner, and the dog eats the string that the murderer used for strangulating the victim. Later the dog dies. This gives you even more ideas, and you write them all down. It does not matter that you are now far removed from the original prompt - the only thing that matters is that you keep on getting ideas.
            When you have finished this line of thought and written everything down, you look at the photo again. The desert makes you think of a remote place. Maybe the murderer drops the weapon in a remote place like an empty construction site in the far part of town. You write it down.
            The sand makes you think of the beach. Maybe the murderer goes to the beach and dumps the murder weapon in the ocean. You write it down, and keep writing down your ideas</p>
        <p>When you feel you have mined this prompt for all ideas you click next, and get a new image or word, and you keep going like this.</p>
        <h3>3. Save the result. </h3>
        <p>Finally, you get the full list of all the ideas you came up with. The IdeaHelper has helped you come up with some ideas. Save or copy the result into a document. 
            Now it is up to you to sort through the ideas and think through what will really work.</p>
